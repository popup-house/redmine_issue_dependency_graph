This is a simple plugin to render a graph of the issues in a version that
have precedes/follows relationships to other tickets in the version.

Once the plugin is installed, a Link will show up in the Sidebar of the Issues Page.


# Installation requirements

## Redmine 3.0.3

This plugin was made to work with Redmine 3.0.3



## Graphviz

This plugin uses graphviz to render the graphs; you'll need to install it
and have it available in the PATH of the redmine app server before this
plugin will work at all.
